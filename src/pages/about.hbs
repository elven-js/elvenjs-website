  <h1>About ElvenJS</h1>

  <p>The ElvenJS is a browser-based script allowing you to interact with the MultiversX blockchain and smart
    contracts without additional configuration or build steps.</p>

  <p>How is it possible? Is this some new SDK for MultiversX?</p>

  <p>Not really a new SDK. ElvenJS is a thin wrapper over the <a
      href="https://docs.multiversx.com/sdk-and-tools/sdk-js/" class="common-link" target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noreferrer">JS SDK</a> libraries. Prepared as a plug-n-play version
    that can handle the most common and simple use cases, like widgets on static websites or additions to existing
    CMS-based websites and e-commerce platforms.</p>

  <p>You can read more in the <a href="/docs/getting-started.html" class="common-link" target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noreferrer">Get started</a> section.</p>
